;; Acceptance for kotoba-build: build the example app, serve it with the dev
;; server, and DRIVE IT IN A REAL BROWSER.
;;
;; Why a browser and not a unit test: this repo's claim is that a Kotoba app
;; can be built and looked at. A test that asserted the plan's shape would
;; pass on a day when the page loaded to a blank screen -- and a page that
;; renders but never responds to a click is the same failure one step later.
;; So the last three checks are: the DOM the guest drew, the click the driver
;; carried back, and the state it changed.
;;
;; The browser is launched headless over CDP, the way
;; `kotoba-lang/htmldom/conformance/cdp_dump.cljs` does (prior art in this
;; workspace; a third copy of this glue should become a library instead).
;; Node's WebSocket global is used directly -- no `ws` dependency.
;;
;; Exit codes: 0 passed, 1 failed, 2 REFUSED (a tool needed to answer is
;; missing -- and a skipped check is not a pass).
